## Bucket Buddy
This is my updated web app called **Bucket Buddy**. It lets users log in with GitHub, create bucket list items, view them, mark them completed, or delete them. The site uses **Express** for the server, **MongoDB Atlas** for persistent storage, and **Bootstrap** for styling.  

Irt has three main pages:  
- **Login page** (login.html): sign in with GitHub.  
- **Home page** (index.html): form to add new items.  
- **All Items page** (results.tml): shows all your items, both active and completed, with actions.  

Every item is tied to he logged-in GitHub user, so users only see their own bucket list.  
## Technical Achievements

**Tech Achievement 1: Express server with MongoDB persistence**  
- I converted the old Node server into an **Express** server.  
- All items are stored in MongoDB Atlas instead of in-emory, so they survive restarts.  
- Each item has `title`, `category`, `priority`, `targetDate`, `addedAt`, and `completed`.  

**Tech Achievement 2: Full CRUD with login protection**  
- Create: Add items via the form on Home.  
- Read: Fetch and display items in tables on the Results page.  
- Update: Mark an item as compleed(moves into the completed table).  
- Delete: Remove an item permanently.  
- All routes are **protected** by login, so only authenticated users can use them.  

**Tech Achievement 3: GitHub OAuth login with Passport.js (extra 10 pts)**  
- Login is handled with **passport-github2**.  
- If the user is new, a record sis made automatically.  
- If the user is returning, their data loads.  
- Navbar updates dynamically to show “Login” or “Logout” depending on session state.  

**Tech Achievement 4: Sessions stored in Mongo**  
- Using `express-session` + `connect-mongo`.  
- This way sessions persist and usesrs stay logged in across refreshes.

## Design / Evaluation Achievements

**Design Achievement 1: Bootstrap styling**  
- I used Bootstrap 5 for everything: navbar, forms, buttons, tables, and cards.  
- Minimal custom CSS, just enough for spacing.  
- Pages look consistent and responsive.  

**Design Achievement 2: Accessibility / W3C tips**  
- All form inputs have `<label>`s.  
- Headingss use proper hierarchy (`h1`, `h2`).  
- Buttons have real text (not just icons).  
- Colors come from Bootstrap, which pass contrast checks.  
- Naxvbar is keyboard-accessible.  
- Meta viewport and meta descriptions added.  

**Design Achievement 3: CRAP principles**  
- **Contrast**: Buttons are bold (primary, success, danger).  
- **Repetition**: Same navbar + fonts across all pages.  
- **Alignment**: Bootsstrap grid keeps forms and tables lined up.  
- **Proximity**: Labels are grouped tighdtly with their inputs.

## Middleware Used
- **express.json()** → parse JSON bodies.  
- **express.static()** → serve static files.  
- **express-session** → session management.  
- **connect-mongo** → store sessiorns in MongoDB.  
- **passport** → auth middleware.  
- **passport-github2** → GitHub OAuth login.  
- **dotenv** → load `.env` secrets.  
- **ensureLoggedIn** (custom) → bl9ock routes if not logged in.

## Lighthouse Scores

I tested in Chrome DevTools:  
- Performance: ~100  
- Best Practices: 95  
- Accessibility: 100  
- SEO: 90 
this passes the assignment requirement (90+ in all four).
